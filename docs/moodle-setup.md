Moodle Web services setup
====


The are different ways to setup Moodle webservices and MDroid has been built to work with almost all of them. Below listed are 2 common methods.


----------------------------------------


## 1. Simple setup

This uses built-in service, named ```moodle_mobile_app``` 
  
Pros:

  * Simple to setup
  * Also works official Moodle app
  
Cons

  * No messaging support
  * Less / no control over features

You can live with the cons? Setup your Moodle server with instructions: [Simple Webservices setup](simple-webservices-setup.md)


-----------------------------------------


## 2. Advanced setup

This uses custom service, to be named ```mdroid_service```.

Pros:

  * Messaging support
  * Total control over features

Cons:

  * Time taking setup (15-20 mins if you are lucky)
  * Could be tidious to get it working (if your are not lucky)

Have patience and time? Setup your Moodle server with instructions: [Advanced Webservices setup](advanced-webservices-setup.md)


------------------------------------------


## Additional setup

**Note:**This is completely optional

<b>Not</b> doing this setup will <b>not</b> impose any additional limitations to your users. However, I encourage you to do this for the setup is: 

  * Really simple
  * Quick
  * Gives a better experience to users 

In a nutshell, we will setup a new theme exclusively for mobile users. Check instructions: [Additional setup](additional-setup.md)

**Warning:** The documentation for this section is not complete. I have been trying to pack more features in to the app and writting docs is currently my last, not least, priority.

**Hint:** You may contribute and help in writing docs (credit will be given) or check back in sometime.
