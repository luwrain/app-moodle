Simple Webservices setup
====

**Note:** Docs for this section are not ready yet. So, I'm referring you to the official docs from Moodle

Check docs for your moodle version below:

 * [2.7](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.6](https://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.5](https://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.4](https://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.3](https://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.2](https://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.1](https://docs.moodle.org/21/en/Using_web_services)
 * [2.0](https://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Using_web_services)
 * [1.9](https://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Using_web_services)

All steps are not necessary. Just 1, 2 and 6 for this simple setup.


**Tip:** If you are not aware of your moodle version just pick 2.4. The docs are more or less similar

**Note:** Help me in writing docs for this section and get credits.
