ABSOLUTE ZERO USER DATA

The application does <b>NOT</b> collect any data related to user or their Moodle account / server. You can absolutely be certain that the information you enter or access using MDroid is all yours and NO user data is being collected, whatsoever. The app however, collects anonymous usage stats - interaction with the app - screen navigation and clicks.

Should you have any further concerns, you may write an email and I assure you a prompt response. Happy Moodling with MDroid.


Best,<br/>
Praveen.
